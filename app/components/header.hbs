<h1>Horde Damage Calculator</h1>
<p>
  Want to simulate multiple attacks on a single target without rolling every die? Enter the attack details, the number of attacks, and the AC of the target, and the tool will calculate the damage to the target and display the total damage alongside a breakdown of each attack.
</p>
<p>
  This uses a 20-sided die for attack rolls, as in D&D 5e and similar systems. If an attack is a critical hit (rolls a 20), the damage dice are rolled twice. Rolling a 1 always misses.
